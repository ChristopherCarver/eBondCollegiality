# About

eBonding is a term used to describe the electronic passing of information for business-to-business (B2B) operations. Typically eBonding is used to keep two system of records in sync. A record on one system has the same information for a record on a different system. Each system passes information between each other as information on the record changes; hence both records contain the same information. Businesses setup and configure eBonding as a means to maintain a system of record they control automatically saving time and resources; i.e., billing, audit, automation, etc. etc.. 

Multi-source eBonding is when you have three or more systems coordinating together on the same record from multiple sources. Multi-source eBonding is a mature B2B model for multi-supplier strategies, where one company coordinates with different multiple suppliers that provide various services within an organization. The advantage of a multi-supplier model is the model provides an organization the ability to right-size their enterprise needs across many suppliers that render a variety of services. Versus letting a single supplier render all operational needs within an organization. 

This article is to help ServiceNow admins to setup multi-source eBonding framework for incident tickets. Incidents are normally a prime candidate to be shared across multiple suppliers. When an outage to a service is reported, there could be multiple suppliers working together to resolve the incident. Also if a supplier is utilized as an external call center, then routing incoming incident tickets to the appropriate secondary supplier needs to be performed. Given these two scenarios enterprises typically model, make incidents the first type of ticket to build a multi-source eBond framework. The same framework can be applied to other ticket types in ServiceNow with some minor adjustments.

## Progressive thoughts
\
Here are the progressive thoughts as multi-source eBonding is being developed to go back and refer too.
- You enterprise will eBond with suppliers, so therefore is makes sense to create company records in the core_company table for each supplier. 
- Company records need to be associated with the local ServiceNow accounts which are used by the supplier to eBond with ServiceNow. This will help you keep track what ServiceNow account is used by the supplier to make their RESTful API calls.
- eBond enabled companies only need to be associated with accounts that have the role of **eBond Account**. 
- eBonding is triggered based on the **Assignment Group** a record to assigned to. Therefore, group (sys_user_group) records need to associated with the companies that ServiceNow are eBonded with. Then in a business rule, if the assignment group company is eBonded, then continue to eBond operations. 
- Turning off/on eBonding is as simple as toggling the company record in the core_company table.

## Follow along
\
Each section will include an update set for those that wish to install the multi-source eBonding on their instance and the instructions to create the update set. ServiceNow offers many ways to solve a problem or configure an operational model. These instructions are _a_ way and does not represent _the_ way on creating a multi-source eBonding framework. The best way to use these instructions is to read through them and see how the framework can be adopted and modified to fit your organization.  

!!! note Update sets 
    The instructions do not cover how-to use update sets or the nuisances of update sets. You can explore on how to leverage update sets within the online ServiceNow documentation.  

!!! note Terms & Meanings
    - _Supplier:_ The legal entity that ServiceNow connects too. You can substitute supplier for vendor.
    - _Company:_ A record from the core_company table in ServiceNow. 

!!! danger Modifying OOTB tables
    The article focuses on creating a robust framework tied closely to the out of the box (OOTB) tables already existing in ServiceNow. There are plenty of alternative implementation solutions at your disposal to accomplish the same result. Your mileage may vary depending on scope defined by and practices set by your organization.

# Foundation setup

The foundation setup is based on the premise that when an incident is created the *Service* and *Service Offering* within an incident are mandatory fields. This is a best practice to follow with a multi-supplier strategy for the enterprise. The reason is this removes the question "who supports this" and focuses on the true issue of "what is broken?" Who solves the incident is not of any concern to most customers and requiring customers or fulfillers to know what assignment group to assign a ticket in large enterprise environments is unreasonable and prone to misrouted tickets. 

**Service Offering** --> **Assignment group** --> **Company** --> **User account**

The *Service Offering* within an incident determines who the ticket is assigned to in the *Assignment group*. The *Assignment group* will be linked to a supplier (company record). This allows enterprises the ability to swap out suppliers across various services within ServiceNow quickly and easily reducing long term run and maintain costs.

!!! note Assignment groups
    Normally an *Assignment group* will contain all the members that support the *Service Offering** within an incident. In the eBond case it is normal if their are no members of an *Assignment group*. It is also normal to have members in an *Assignment group* that is eBonded with a supplier as well; where the enterprise allows the supplier to log into the enterprise ServiceNow to fulfill tickets. Either scenario still works with eBonding.   

The supplier will have a company record that is linked to a user record that represents the eBond account the supplier will use to make inbound RESTful calls. This will become a means to quickly identify what account a company uses for eBonding and creates a "lockout" point for security.

## Demo data
\
This how-to provides demo data that you can use to test the multi-source eBonding framework. The scenario is your organization has hired Alpha Co. and Beta Co. to supply IT services across your enterprise. Alpha Co. supplies data center operations and Beta Co. supplies backup and recovery operations for the data center. An incident occurred at the data center where both Alpha Co. and Beta Co. need to work together to resolve the incident.

## Update set
\
*eBond Collegiality v1.0*

## Add eBond account role
\
The *eBond Account* role denotes which accounts are used by suppliers to eBond with your instance of ServiceNow. Each supplier should have their own local ServiceNow account that the supplier will use to connect to your instance of ServiceNow passing inbound REST payloads. This role will be used in various ways in the multi-source eBond framework. 

1. Navigate to **User Administration** > **Roles** and click **New**.
1. Under *Role New Record*, fill in the following fields:
    - _Name:_ eBond Account
    - _Description:_ Denotes the sys_user account is to be used for eBonding activities.
1. Click **Submit**, which will create the new role.

!!! note Demo Data - User accounts

!!! note Demo Data - Assignment Groups
    Setting up two support groups; *Data Center Operations Support* and *Backup and Recovery Support*. The reason the group names are not associated with the names of the suppliers is a run and maintain operation decision. Most of the time a supplier will support multiple *Service offerings*, when an organization desires to replace a supplier, instead of updating multiple *Service offerings*, only the support group *Company* field need to be updated. This is a minor detail as many organizations choose to name the assignment groups after the supplier and that is perfectly fine.

    1. Navigate to **User Administration** > **Groups**, and click **New**.
    1. Under the **Group New Record** section, fill in the following fields:
        - _Name:_ Data Center Operations Support

## Service, service offering, and assignment group alignment in incidents
\
Ticket mis-routing is problem in all services organization and surveys show that customer satisfaction reduces the more a ticket is re-routed. To reduce ticket mis-routes, the service, service offering, and assignment group need to be in alignment. It is unreasonable to expect that fulfillers know which support group supports what services. In large enterprises with hundreds of various services, internal teams, and external suppliers ticket mis-routing is common without alignment between all three fields. 

!!! note Optional setup

## Associate incidents with eBond companies
\
Fulfillers will need the ability to eBond incidents with suppliers. And we have partially started the setup that a trigger point will be the *Assignment group* in an incident. Now we will start to add custom fields to the *incident* table to enhance further functionality that will support and aid in multi-source eBonding.

!!! note Assignment group
    Later on we will configure how changing the *Assignment group* will affect the *eBonded with* field. 

There are two main ways to eBond an incident to a supplier; first via the *Assignment group* and the second via a custom field called *eBonded with*. The *eBonded with* will serve a dual purpose. First, it will represent all the suppliers the ticket is eBonded with in a list. A fulfiller will then have the ability to quickly see what suppliers the ticket is eBonded too. Second, it will toggle eBonding and deBonding operations when suppliers are added or removed from the list. That way a fulfiller can initiate an eBond or deBond with a supplier without having to change the *Assignment group."

!!! note eBonded with
    This field expects the fulfiller to know which suppliers to eBond with and the service offerings the supplier provides. If the fulfiller does not know the proper supplier, then they should use the *Service* and *Service offering* fields to set the *Assignment group* field to the appropriate group.

!!! note deBonding
    deBonding is the opposite of eBonding by breaking the connection between the tickets. After a ticket has been deBonded from a company, the ticket can be re-eBonded to the company by adding the company back to the list. In the event of a re-eBonding, there is no guarantee the company ticket will be the same . 

1. Navigate to **System Definition** > **Tables** and search for the *incident* table under the **Name** field.
1. Open the *Incident* record and click **New** under the **Columns** tab.
1. Under the **Dictionary Entry New Record** section, fill in the following fields:
    - _Type:_ List 
    - _Column label:_ eBonded with
    - _Column name:_ (this should default to u_eBonded_with)
1. Under the **Reference Specification** tab, fill in the following fields:
    - _Reference:_ core_company
    - _Reference qual condition:_
        - eBonded is true AND
        - eBond Account is not empty
1. Click **Submit**.
1. Navigate to **Incident** > **All** and open any incident record.
1. Navigate to **Additional actions** > **Configure** > **Form Layout**, which will bring up the **Configuring Company form**.
1. Under the **Available** list, find the *eBonded with* field and add it **>** to the **Selected** list.
1. Move the *eBonded with* field up the **Selected** list **^** to be below the *Assigned to*.
1. Click **Save**.

# Custom tables

eBonding will require the creation of custom tables or the extension of existing tables. ServiceNow sets a limit on the number of custom tables an instance can have before additional costs are accrued/incurred. This how-to will create custom tables as there are no similar tables in ServiceNow that are proper candidates to extend. You however can take any of the base tables in ServiceNow and extend them adding the custom fields and it will work the same.

## eBond relationships
\
The *u_eBond_relationship* table is a multi-relational table that represents a one to many record mapping for an incident ticket to be mapped to multiple supplier tickets. 

The *u_eBond_relationship* table will contain the following custom fields:
|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Type|The type of eBond that was established with the vendor.|
|Table sys ID|The ServiceNow record sys_id on the instance.|
|Table name|The table the ServiceNow record resides on.|
|Status|The status of the eBond.|
|State|The state of the eBond.|
|Correlation Number|The supplier's ticket number or designation|
|Correlation ID|The supplier's ticket sys id or reference|
|Company|The ServiceNow supplier company record on the instance.|
|URL|Link to the supplier ticket.|
|Reflect|Changes made by the supplier are reflected in the ticket.|

The fields relate the ServiceNow ticket to the various suppliers the ticket is eBonded too.

## eBond Properties
\
The *u_ebond_registry* table is similar to that of the *sys_properties* table in that it stores generic properties and values for eBonding. If you choose to use the *sys_properties* table, then make sure to look through the various scripts that reference the *u_ebond_registry* table in this how-to and change as appropriate.

The *u_ebond_registry* table will contain the following custom fields:
|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Supplier|"All" or the name of the supplier.|
|Key|The key variable name.|
|Value|The property variable value.|

1. Navigate to **System Definition** > **Tables**.
1. Click **New**.

## eBond Logs
\
The *u_ebond_log* table is similar to that of the *syslog* table in that it stores generic log information. If you choose to use the *syslog* table, then make sure to look through the various scripts that reference the *u_ebond_log* table. The *syslog* table has a granulairty of seconds and ServiceNow performs multiple operations per second. Hence the order of the logs messages become out of order. It is recommended that you use the *u_ebond_log* to help with debugging as the *Index* column is a sequential integer to aid in showing the order of operations.

!!! note Evaluator messages
The *u_ebond_log* table does not capture *Evaluator* messages from faulted JavaScript execution. Use the *syslog* table to check for failed JavaScript executions.

The *u_ebond_log* table will contain the following custom fields:
|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Index|Auto-incrementing numeric value.|
|Supplier|Name of the supplier.|
|Class|Name of the ServiceNow component, i.e., script include, business rule, workflow, etc. etc..|
|Source|Label of the ServiceNow component.|
|Message|The log message.|
|Level|Choice value of *High*, *Medium*, *Low*.|

# Multi-source Inbound Handling

Inbound incident handling could be setup in an agnostic fashion based on a mutual push-push model setup between the enterprise and suppliers. The mutual push-push model is where the each party sets how they shall receive messages and no party performs a pull/get operation. There are major advantages for this model over one party dictating both how it will send and receive messages. 

!!! note OEM & OSP
    Original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and original service providers (OSP) rarely fit into the mutual push-push model as their clientele is vast and the reliance of the enterprise on the OEMs and OSPs do not warrant a collaborative effort between the enterprise ServiceNow developers and the OEM/OSP. In the case of true partnership between enterprise and suppliers should allow for a mutual push-push model.    

The biggest advantage to all parties is long term run and maintain of eBonding operations. If one party changes their fields or data, the other party is not forced into changing their eBonding framework to accommodate; a decision from one party should not impact or cause work for the other. Another advantage is resource utilization. Pull requests are expensive and if an enterprise is being pulled by dozens of suppliers, this places an undue burden on the enterprise. It is far more agreeable that if a change is to occur in one party's record, then that party will pass (push) the delta change to the agreed parties.

---
## Quick Rundown
\
Suppliers will write to a staging table called *[u_ebond_incident_staging]*. The table will be an extension of the *[sys_import_set_row]* and will have the ability to take advantage of the OOTB ServiceNow transform functionality. The *transform maps* will validate the incoming data and then create or update the appropriate records within the system.

---
## Incident staging table
\
Normally the REST inbound message handling aspect for eBonding is developed using *Scripted REST API*. For multi-source eBonding a different model will be developed using a staging table. Suppliers will directly write to a staging table instead of a Scripted REST API.

ServiceNow *Transform Maps* provide an elegant and efficient means to do much of what a *Scripted REST API* can do with the use of *Transform Scripts*. The **onStart** is used for preparation of global variables, *onBefore* is used for data validation, and *onAfter* for data operations. All of this efficiently designed by Servicenow in the import set framework to handle inbound REST messages.

!!! note Staging other tables
    For each type of destination ServiceNow table for multi-source eBonding will require a unique staging table. For example, if the requirement is to have a multi-source eBond with change requests, a similar staging table that that below will need to be created.

The *u_ebond_incident_staging* table holds the field values passed by the supplier for incidents.

The *u_ebond_incident_staging* table will contain the following custom fields:
|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Work Note|Support work note, customer not visible.|
|Subcategory|Subcategory for the incident.|
|State|The state of the incident.|
|Short Description|The title (or short description) of the incident.|

|Service|The service the incident is impacting.|
|Priority|The priority level of the incident.|

|Number|The number for the local incident ticket.|
|Hold Reason|The reason the incident ticket was placed on hold.|
|Description|The description of the incident.|
|Contact Type|How the incident was reported.|
|Comment|Customer visible comment.|
|External Reference|The supplier's incident ticket unique identifier.|
|External Number|The supplier's incident ticket number.|

|Close Notes|Incident closure notes.|
|Close Code|Incident closure code.|
|Category|Category for the incident|
|Caller|The caller who reported the incident.|
|Assignment Group|The assignment group working the incident.|

## Inbound Transform
\
The inbound *transform map* uses *transform scripts* to perform various operations on the data directly passed by the supplier. The *transform scripts* can be set to *when* they are executed against the data in the transform. 

- **onStart:** Sets up the global variables used by the other transform scripts. Global variables will be capitalized for ease of development. 
- **onBefore:** Validates security and the data passed by the supplier. The order of scripts are important as pre-checks must complete before continuing the transform.  
- **on:After** Creates or updates the needed fields within the records. 
- **on:Complete** Verifies all operations and updates return information to the supplier. 

1. Navigate to **System Import Sets** > **Transform Maps**.
1. Click **New**.
1. In the **Table Transform Map New record** section, fill in the following fields:
    - _Name:_ eBond Incident Transform
    - _Source table:_ Incident Staging [u_ebond_incident_staging]
    - _Target table:_ Relationship [u_ebond_relationship]
1. In the record header, right-click and select **Save**.

1. In the **Field Map New record** section, fill in the following fields:
    - _Source field:_ External Number [u_external_number]
    - _Target field:_ Correlation Number [u_correlation_number]
    - _Coalesce:_ True
1. Click **Submit**.

    !!! note Coalesce field not indexed
        If a pop-up box appears titled *Coalesce field not indexed*, then click **OK**, fill in the followup contact information and click **OK**.

1. Click **Submit**.

    !!! note Coalesce fields
        Only the *target field* fields *u_correlation_number* and *u_company* fields are coalesce fields. The *u_company* is derived internally from the *sys_created_by* field that holds the account that wrote the record. This removes the means to supplant company information. The *u_correlation_number* by itself is not sufficient to make it unique enough with multiple eBonded suppliers. The combination of the *u_correlation_number* and *u_company* is required; as the assumption is the supplier will not duplicate their ticket numbers. However, two or more suppliers could have the same ticket numbers unrelated to each other.

1. In the **Transform Scripts** tab, click **New**.
1. In the **Transform Script New record** section, fill in the following fields:
    - _When:_ onStart
    - _Script:_

        ````
        // Initialize global variables
        //                       
        var LOGING = false;
        var COMPONENT = "Transform Map";
        var SOURCE = "eBond Incident Transform";
        ````
1. Click **Submit**.
