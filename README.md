# About

eBonding is a term used to describe the electronic passing of information for business-to-business (B2B) operations. Typically eBonding is used to keep two system of records in sync. A record on one system has the same information for a record on a different system. Each system passes information between each other as information on the record changes; hence both records contain the same information. Businesses setup and configure eBonding as a means to maintain a system of record they control automatically saving time and resources; i.e., billing, audit, automation, etc. etc.. 

Multi-source eBonding is when you have three or more systems coordinating together on the same record from multiple sources. Multi-source eBonding is a mature B2B model for multi-supplier strategies, where one company coordinates with different multiple suppliers that provide various services within an organization. The advantage of a multi-supplier model is the model provides an organization the ability to right-size their enterprise needs across many suppliers that render a variety of services. Versus letting a single supplier render all operational needs within an organization.
